Embarking on a daring web development quest, I'm building a basic recipe website to refine my HTML skills and defy conventional learning. This culinary sanctuary will evolve into a visual feast with CSS. Through innovative iterations, I'll create vivid recipe pages and integrate them into the main index. By mastering HTML, Git, and GitHub, I'll publish the project via GitHub Pages, paving the way for complex web development and my ultimate goal: unraveling cyber-security mysteries, making an indelible mark on the digital landscape, and proving that I can break the mold.
